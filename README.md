**ShaojianL/ShaojianL** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on receptor mediated endocytosis.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, c++, SQL, DNA and Protein analysis using machine learning techniques.
- This account and its repository is created for the assignments/mini-projects in undergraduate CMPT courses at SFU, there is no note worthy project in this account.
